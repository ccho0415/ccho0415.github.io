	<h3>What is a data structure?</h3>
		<p>A data structure is a way of organizing information</p>
	<h3>What is an algorithm?</h3>
		<p>An algorithm is a sequence of steps that is performed on a data structure in order to solve certain tasks</p>	
	<h3>Basic Data Structures</h3>
		<li>Array</li>
			<ul>A data structure that contains a contiguous set of elements where you only need to know the location of the initial element location in order to find the entire structure</ul>
			<li>Types of Searches for Array</li>
				<li>Unsorted</li>
					<ul>Linear/Sequential Search : O(n)</ul>
				<li>Sorted</li>
					<ul>Binary Search : O(lg(n))</ul>	
		<li>Array List</li>
			<ul>A class that wraps around an Array that allows you to use methods to resize, change and grow the array as needed</ul>
			<h4>Example for Array List</h4>
			<code>
				ArrayList<AnyType> myArray = new ArrayList<Integer>();
			</code>
			<br><br>
		<li>Linked List</li>
			<ul>A data structure that has a node with data, and a reference to the next element of the list(singly) or a reference to the next and previous elements of the list (doubly) </ul>
